# Arrays

Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.

# Characterstics Of Arrays

1. An array holds elements that have the same data type.
2. Array elements are stored in subsequent memory locations.
3. An array can either be an integer, character, or float data type that can be initialised only during the declaration.
4. An array is an indexed collection of data elements of the same type. Indexed means that the array elements are numbered (starting at 0).
5. The particular element of an array can be modified separately without changing the other elements.
6. The pointer points to the first location of memory block, which is allocated to the array name.

# Types Of Arrays
1. One-Dimensional Arrays (Single Indexed Arrays)

<br>


2. Multidimensional Arrays (Multi Indexed Arrays)
    * Two-Dimensional Arrays
    * Three-Dimensional Arrays

3. Associative Arrays --> Associative arrays are also called map or dictionaries. In c++ programming language, an associative array is a special type of array in which the index value can be of any data type i.e. it can be char, float, string, etc.

Also, the indexes are given a different name which is key and the data that is stored at the position of the key is value. So, we can define the associative array as a key-value pair.

    Note --> There are no associative arrays in the C language. Some libraries provide hash tables, red-black trees, or other data structures that can become associative arrays.
