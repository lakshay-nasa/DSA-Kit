# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

* Linked List is a collection of Nodes.
* Each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
* Nodes are randomly stored in the memory.

# Types Of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly/Double Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

<br>

Note ---> Both Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List can be made into a circular linked list.

<br>
<br>

# Circular Linked List
Circular Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which the first element points to the last element and the last element points to the first element.

## Applications of Circular Linked List
* It is used in multiplayer games to give a chance to each player to play the game.
* Multiple running applications can be placed in a circular linked list on an operating system. The os keeps on iterating over these applications.
* Round Robin scheduling technique in games. (The round robin tournament algorithm is an algorithm that pairs students up without repeating the same pair more than once)
* Audio/Video Streaming
* Circular Escalators

# Double Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

--> Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.

### Some Points To Remember

Each Node has # Components -->
* prev - address of the previous node
* data - data item
* next - address of next node

## Applications of Circular Linked List

### Applications of Doubly Linked List:

* Doubly linked list can be used in navigation systems where both forward and backward traversal is required.
* It can be used to implement different tree data structures.
* It can be used to implement undo/redo operations. 

### Real-Time Applications of Doubly Linked List:

* Doubly linked lists are used in web page navigation in both forward and backward directions.
* It can be used in games like a deck of cards.

## Operation on Linked List -->
* Transversion
* Insertion --> 
    1. At the beginning
    2. Insertion at the end
    3. Insertion after a specific element (in between elements)
* Deletion -->
    1. Delete first element
    2. Delete the last element
    3. Delete at a given position
* Searching

<br>

Note --> These operations can be performed on all types of Linked List.
