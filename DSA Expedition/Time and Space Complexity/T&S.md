# Getting Started

There are multiple ways to solve a problem in computer science with different algorithms. 
So, it is important to find the best optimal solution to a problem.

To find a best algorithm we need certain method of comparison, but the method must be - 
* Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
* Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
* Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.

<br>


What is considered as a good algorithm?

A good algorithm is one that takes less time in execution and saves space during the process.
<br>
<br>

### We can analyze the Algorithm with two methods: -

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity



<br>
<br>


# Time Complexity

* It shows us the performance of an Algorithm with time. 

Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

Time Complexity is a mathematical Function. It is a function that shows us a relationship between the time and the length of the input.



<br>

    *Note - Time Complexity is not equal to the time taken by the machine to run a program. It is independent of the machine and configuration used.

<br>


## Points to Remember when dealing with time complexity -

1. Always look for worst case complexity.
2. Go for complexity of larger or infinite data.
3. Drop the Constants.
4. Ignore the less-dominating terms.

## Different Time Complexities Comparison-

<br>


Constant < Logarithmic < Linear < Linearithmic < Quadratic < Cubic < Exponential < Factorial

<br>


<b> y(1) < y(log n) < y(n) < y(n log n) < y(n^2) < y(n^3) < y(2^n) < y(n!)
</b>

    Note - Above complexities only gives us the basic idea. These are not the only complexities, we need to figure it out ourselves while solving a questions.
