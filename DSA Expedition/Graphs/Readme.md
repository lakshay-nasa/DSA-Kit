# Graphs

A graph is a collection of nodes connected through edges.

Note -> A Tree is also a type of graph. (hierarchical Graph)

## Some Points about graphs

* Avertex or node is one fundamental unit/entity of which graphs are formed.
* An edge is uniquely defined by its 2 endpoints.
* Directed Edge - One way connection
* Undirected Edge - Two way connection
* Directed Graph - All directed edges
* Undirected Graph - All undirected edges

## Indegree and Outdegree of a node

1. Indegree -> No of edges going out of the node
2. Outdegree -> No of edges coming into the node

<br>

## Graph Representation

1. Ajacency List 
2. Adjacency Matrix

## Graph Operations

* Graph Traversal
* Check if the element is present in the graph
* Add elements(vertex, edges) to graph
* Finding the path from one vertex to another


## Graph Traversal 

Two Algorithms of Graph Traversalare ->
* Breadth First search (BFS)
* Depth First search (DFS)
